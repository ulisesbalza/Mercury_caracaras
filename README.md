## Abstract

Mercury is a widely available pollutant associated with negative effects on wildlife, especially top
predators. Here, we characterized the mercury concentrations in feathers of Striated Caracara
_Phalcoboenus australis_ on Isla de los Estados (Argentina). With feather mercury levels averaging
26.3 mg/kg, this population has the highest mean feather mercury ever reported for a bird population in
South America. We propose that the high mercury concentrations are related to the feeding habits of the
species: during feather moult, they are strongly associated with a Southern Rockhopper Penguin (_Eudyptes
chrysocome_) colony known to be highly exposed to mercury contamination. Our results suggest that this
Striated Caracara population should be monitored for acute effects and potential impacts of mercury
toxicity.
